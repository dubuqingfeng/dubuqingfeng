```
// G 结构体
type g struct {
	// Stack parameters.
	// stack describes the actual stack memory: [stack.lo, stack.hi).
	// stackguard0 is the stack pointer compared in the Go stack growth prologue.
	// It is stack.lo+StackGuard normally, but can be StackPreempt to trigger a preemption.
	// stackguard1 is the stack pointer compared in the C stack growth prologue.
	// It is stack.lo+StackGuard on g0 and gsignal stacks.
	// It is ~0 on other goroutine stacks, to trigger a call to morestackc (and crash).
	stack       stack   // offset known to runtime/cgo
	stackguard0 uintptr // offset known to liblink
	stackguard1 uintptr // offset known to liblink

	_panic    *_panic // innermost panic - offset known to liblink
	_defer    *_defer // innermost defer
	m         *m      // current m; offset known to arm liblink
	sched     gobuf
	syscallsp uintptr // if status==Gsyscall, syscallsp = sched.sp to use during gc
	syscallpc uintptr // if status==Gsyscall, syscallpc = sched.pc to use during gc
	stktopsp  uintptr // expected sp at top of stack, to check in traceback
	// param is a generic pointer parameter field used to pass
	// values in particular contexts where other storage for the
	// parameter would be difficult to find. It is currently used
	// in three ways:
	// 1. When a channel operation wakes up a blocked goroutine, it sets param to
	//    point to the sudog of the completed blocking operation.
	// 2. By gcAssistAlloc1 to signal back to its caller that the goroutine completed
	//    the GC cycle. It is unsafe to do so in any other way, because the goroutine's
	//    stack may have moved in the meantime.
	// 3. By debugCallWrap to pass parameters to a new goroutine because allocating a
	//    closure in the runtime is forbidden.
